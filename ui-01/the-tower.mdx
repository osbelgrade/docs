When I'm thinking
and have a camera in my hand,

that awkwardness disappears.

The self-consciousness of photographing in public—
that awareness of being watched,
of looking like a tourist,
of intruding—

it all evaporates.

There's only the frame,
the light,
the next composition.

At the Genex Tower,
I saw a door—

unmarked, slightly ajar,
paint peeling at the edges.

I edged it open.

And there:

the void.

That vertical emptiness
stretching up through the building's core,
concrete and shadow and
abandoned height.

I was so excited.

That pure moment—
no thought of whether I should be here,
no awareness of how I look,
just:

*look at this.*

The camera gives me permission

to stop being a person being observed

and become a person observing.
