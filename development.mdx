description: "OS:B is not a standard deployment. Belgrade operates on fundamentally different cultural software than Western systems, and successful integration requires specific prerequisites.  This guide walks through the installation process, configuration options, and common troubleshooting scenarios you'll encounter when adapting to Belgrade's operating protocols."

<Danger>
  **Critical: Proper cultural protocol installation required**

  Incorrect implementation of OS:B integration procedures may result in social incompatibility, extended adaptation periods, or permanent designation as "obvious tourist." Follow all installation steps carefully. Attempting to run Western efficiency protocols on Belgrade infrastructure will cause system conflicts. Do not skip the observation phase.
</Danger>

<Steps>
  <Step title="System Requirements" icon="solar-system" iconType="regular">
    Before attempting to run OS:B protocols, ensure your system meets the minimum requirements:

    ```bash
    Balkans.history >= v1945 (recommended for context)
    Coffee.tolerance = "high" (minimum 3 cups daily)
    Schedule.flexibility = true (required)
    Personal_space.boundaries = "negotiable"
    Cynicism.threshold >= 7/10
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the Belgrade Protocol Suite" icon="browser" iconType="regular">
    Navigate to your docs directory where your `docs.json` file is located, and run the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install -g belgrade-os
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initialise Local Integration" icon="files" iconType="regular">
    Navigate to the neighbourhood where you'll be operating and run the following command:

    ```bash
    belgrade-os init --location zemun
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Custom Operating Modes" icon="location-crosshairs" iconType="regular">
    By default, OS:B operates at Western efficiency standards. You can customize the operational tempo OS:B runs on by using the `--tempo` flag. For example, to run OS:B on Belgrade time, use this command:

    ```bash
    belgrade-os run --tempo balkan --schedule eventual
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Protocol Versions" icon="hands" iconType="regular">
    Please note that each neighborhood is associated with a specific version of Belgrade protocols. If your local behavior does not align with the cultural expectations, please update your integration:

    ```bash
    npm update belgrade-os
    belgrade-os adapt --force
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validating Cultural Competence" icon="not-equal" iconType="regular">
    The system can assist with validating your cultural integration. To identify any protocol violations, use the following command:

    ```bash
    belgrade-os validate --interactions recent --feedback brutal
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Successful Deployment

If cultural integration is successful, you should see the following indicators:

```bash
$ belgrade-os deploy --mode full-integration

Running cultural compatibility checks...

✓ All authenticity checks have passed
✓ Rakija tolerance: operational
✓ Tram navigation: functional
✓ Cynical humor: integrated
✓ Personal space: appropriately compressed
✓ Schedule expectations: appropriately lowered

Deployment successful. Welcome to OS:B.
```

## Recommended Extensions

We suggest developing the following capabilities to enhance your OS:B experience:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Historical Context Mode" icon="rectangle-history" iconType="regular">
    Decodes references to Yugoslav-era systems, 1990s conflicts, and nostalgia-based commentary that frequently appear in local communication. Essential for understanding architectural decisions, casual historical references, and culturally-loaded conversations. Prevents misinterpretation of context-dependent social interactions and enables participation in heritage-based discussions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Volume Calibration" icon="volume" iconType="regular">
    Recalibrates audio processing thresholds to accommodate Belgrade's elevated baseline conversation volume without triggering conflict detection protocols. Differentiates between passionate discussion and actual confrontation. Eliminates false-positive aggression signals in kafanas and public spaces. Adjustment period typically requires 7-14 days of exposure.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Smoking Immunity" icon="smoking" iconType="regular">
    Manages adaptation to indoor smoking environments prevalent in kafanas and social venues. Provides expectation management protocols and seating optimization strategies. Critical for full participation in essential cultural spaces. Does not modify health impacts—users with respiratory conditions should evaluate venue participation independently.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Serbian Language Pack" icon="flag" iconType="regular">
    Provides essential vocabulary for daily operations including kafana ordering, tram navigation, and basic apologies. Reduces dependency on English-only protocols and enables transaction completion without gesture-based workarounds. Significantly improves local perception metrics and reduces communication-based protocol violations during initial integration period.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

**Common Error: Could not parse local social hierarchy**

```bash
$ belgrade-os diagnose --error social_hierarchy

Error: Could not parse local social hierarchy
Status: Common initialization error

Recommended resolution steps:

1. Enter observation mode:
   $ belgrade-os observe --duration 12weeks --mode passive

2. Establish pattern recognition:
   $ belgrade-os frequent --location same_kafana --frequency daily

3. Disable optimization protocols:
   $ belgrade-os config --efficiency false --patience true

4. Reinstall humility protocols:
   $ sudo apt-get install humility-core
   $ belgrade-os reset --assumptions western --ego false
```

## Code Snippets as Cultural Algorithms

By default, OS:B operates at Western efficiency standards. You can customize the operational tempo OS:B runs on by using the `--tempo` flag. For example, to run OS:B on Belgrade time, use this command:

```bash
$ sudo apt-install belgrade-protocols
$ belgrade-os run --tempo balkan --schedule eventual
$ source ~/.belgraderc
$ belgrade-os run --cultural-adaptation-mode active
```

**Example:** If you attempt to board a tram that's already at maximum human density, OS:B will compress your personal space parameters until accommodation is achieved:

```bash
$ belgrade-os board --line 7A --time rush_hour
Warning: Personal space protocols suspended
Compressing boundaries: 100% -> 23% -> 8%
Status: Boarding successful (breathing optional)
```

## Error Messages

Protocol version conflicts occur when local behavioral patterns do not match neighborhood-specific implementations. Each district operates distinct social software variants. Update integration parameters when encountering compatibility errors.

```bash
Error 404: Punctuality Not Found
Warning: cultural_context.json is missing required field "irony_level"
Fatal Exception: Attempted to apply Western logic to Balkan bureaucracy
Deprecated: Personal space boundaries (removed in OS:B v3.0)
```

## Debugging Cultural Misunderstandings

Diagnostic commands identify protocol violations causing integration failures. Execute validation sequences when observing unexpected social responses or error states in local interactions.

```bash
$ belgrade-os validate --interactions recent

Running cultural protocol diagnostics...

ERROR: Protocol mismatch detected
Location: public_transport, kafana_interaction  
Severity: moderate
Type: CulturalAssumptionConflict

Root cause: Western social protocols incompatible
            with local implementation

Recommended action:
  $ belgrade-os reset --assumptions false
  $ belgrade-os observe --mode passive --duration extended
  $ belgrade-os adapt --based-on local_behavior

Validation complete. 3 violations found.
```

## Deployment Confirmation

Successful cultural integration produces specific observable indicators. Execute status checks to verify OS:B protocols are functioning correctly. System will output confirmation messages when behavioral adaptation reaches operational thresholds.

```bash
$ belgrade-os deploy --mode full-integration
