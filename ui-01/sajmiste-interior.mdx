The stairwell floods with light
through broken windows.

Beautiful, almost.

Laundry hangs on lines
strung between crumbling walls—
someone's Tuesday, someone's routine.

Silent corridors.
Bolted doors.
Notices in Cyrillic I can't read.

I probably shouldn't be here.

People live here.

In these barracks.
In Sajmište.

Where thousands were murdered.

They hang their washing.
They bolt their doors.
They come home at night.

The derelict garage doors are made of lithographic plates,
stamped metal warped and rusting—
repurposed, functional, nobody's monument.

A solitary lady appears.

"Dobar dan."

Good day.

As if this is just another building.
As if the walls don't remember.
As if ordinary life could cover anything.

The temperature drops

as I walk toward the river,
away from where they died,
toward the sliding city.
