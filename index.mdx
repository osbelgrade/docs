## Quickstart

OS:B documents Belgrade as software requiring technical specifications. Rather than traditional travel writing, this project creates the manual for Belgrade's cultural operating system - installation guides, protocol documentation, error logs, and troubleshooting sequences. The format isn't metaphorical: poems are written as functioning Python code, hosted on developer documentation infrastructure, and organized using actual software documentation standards.

## Atttributes

OS:B organizes cultural documentation into technical categories mirroring standard software documentation structure. Each section addresses different aspects of Belgrade's operating system, from core functionality to system errors.

## Element Provisioning

OS:B employs authentic software documentation aesthetics to create functional technical manuals that contain poetry. Visual design serves the conceptual framework rather than decorating it.

## In-Depth Guides

OS:B acknowledges fundamental paradoxes in cultural documentation while proceeding anyway. The project embraces contradictions inherent in attempting systematic analysis of systems that resist systematisation.

## Output Functionality

OS:B produces multiple output formats exploring Belgrade's operating system through different media while maintaining conceptual coherence.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Primary Publication" icon="eye" iconType="regular">
    Poetry collection formatted as technical documentation with full visual design treatment. Complete software manual aesthetic including system requirements, error messages, troubleshooting guides, and version histories. Authentic enough to function as actual software documentation until opened to reveal cultural observation poetry.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Supplementary Material" icon="books" iconType="regular">
    Interactive digital edition with functional documentation interface. Audio documentation incorporating field recordings as "system sounds." Visual flowcharts and cultural decision trees mapping behavioral protocols. QR codes linking poems to contextual materials and location-specific recordings.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="WWTC Integration" icon="masks-theater" iconType="regular">
    OS:B becomes the Belgrade chapter of Warsaw Winter Theatre Company's traveling investigation methodology. Demonstrates how each city requires different analytical frameworks and documentation approaches. Contributes to broader investigation of cities as performance spaces and cultural simulation mechanisms.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Timeline Flexibility" icon="timeline" iconType="regular">
    Thematic rather than chronological structure eliminates daily output pressure. Poems emerge from genuine encounters with Belgrade's operating system rather than forced documentation schedules. Any encounter becomes potential documentation material when observation reveals underlying protocols worth recording.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Version Control" icon="lightbulb-gear" iconType="regular">
    Documentation tracks Belgrade protocol evolution over 12-week residency period. Each poem receives version numbering indicating iteration and refinement as understanding deepens. Changelog documents shifts in cultural comprehension and adaptation progress.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## OS:B Roadmap

OS:B development follows a 12-week deployment cycle divided into distinct phases. Each phase addresses different integration depths and documentation requirements.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Phase 01: Initial Boot (Weeks 1 - 3)" icon="code-branch" iconType="regular">
    System initialization and basic protocol installation. Focus on core navigation systems, essential vocabulary acquisition, and fundamental behavioral pattern recognition. Documentation covers first-contact experiences, error frequency analysis, and primary assumption conflicts. Output: Initial protocol documentation and navigation guides.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Phase 02: Core Integration (Weeks 4 - 7)" icon="code-fork" iconType="regular" stepNumber={2}>
    Deeper protocol adaptation and social system engagement. Investigation of kafana culture, informal economy mechanics, and background process identification. Documentation examines memory management systems, historical context integration, and legacy code influence. Output: Core function documentation and cultural algorithm specifications.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Phase 03: Advanced Protocols (Weeks 8 - 10)" icon="code-merge" iconType="regular">
    Complex system analysis and edge case documentation. Focus on subtle cultural variations, neighborhood-specific implementations, and system error identification. Documentation explores version history, backward compatibility issues, and protocol evolution patterns. Output: Advanced troubleshooting guides and comparative analyses.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Phase 04: System Refinement (Weeks 11 - 12)" icon="code-commit" iconType="regular">
    Final integration optimization and comprehensive documentation review. Meta-analysis of adaptation progress, persistent protocol conflicts, and integration success metrics. Preparation of complete documentation suite and publication materials. Output: Complete OS:B manual and supplementary materials.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Rationale

The approach taken by OS:B could be genuinely groundbreaking - poetry functioning as both art and actual cultural analysis tool. The WWTC methodology provides intellectual rigor while the OS format makes complex cultural observation accessible and playful. Any Belgrade encounter becomes documentation material: confusing tram experiences become "Navigation Protocol Documentation," kafana evenings become "Social Networking API Reference," bureaucratic puzzles become "Legacy System Troubleshooting Guides." Belgrade will teach its operating system naturally - the project simply requires systematic documentation of discovered cultural software. The visual design potential allows for creation of the most beautiful technical manual ever made - authentic enough to sit alongside actual software documentation until opened to reveal poetry inside
