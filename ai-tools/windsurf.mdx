Configure Windsurf's Cascade AI assistant to help you write and maintain documentation. This guide shows how to set up Windsurf specifically for your Mintlify documentation workflow.

## Prerequisites

- Windsurf editor installed
- Access to your documentation repository

## Workspace rules

Create workspace rules that provide Windsurf with context about your documentation project and standards.

Create `.windsurf/rules.md` in your project root:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Initial System Boot - First Contact Protocol
OS:B v0.1.0 (Unoptimized)
