A walk across the suburban hills to the camp.

The church a brutalist statement in concrete
as water dripped
from rusted pipes.

The lady reading her book
on the edge of the mass grave
as clouds raced overhead.

Flowers drooping to the sound of the workmen - 
working?
On a Sunday?

There was no sense of foreboding here.
Or at least the sense that I am used to.

The happy dog followed me.
