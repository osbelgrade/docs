![Repo Pn](/images/repo.png)

**Reticulate** is my primary blog - the place where longer thoughts, cultural observations, and theoretical tangents live.

It's where I write about what I'm noticing, what I'm reading, what I'm trying to figure out. Sometimes it's photography and urban archaeology. Sometimes it's postmodern theory applied to everyday confusion. Sometimes it's just working through ideas that don't fit anywhere else.

If OS:B is the technical documentation of Belgrade, Reticulate is the messy workshop where I think out loud about everything else.

**Expect:**

- Cultural criticism and observation
- Photography projects
- Theoretical experiments
- Process documentation
- Whatever needs writing that week

No consistent schedule.

No house style.

Just ongoing investigation into whatever demands attention.
