Sunset joins the clamour
Of people heading home along Oslobodjena
The buildings desaturate before my eyes
From rose to grey

Until, gradually
It is only the sound of the trams
that keeps me in this city

That, and the refuse collectors
catching car headlights
in their hi-vis vests
The day's rubbish will vanish
