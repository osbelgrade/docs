Twenty bodies compressed at the platform edge
Shoulders angled forward
Weight already shifting
before the tram appears

The buildings behind them
rise in stained concrete repetition
Balconies stacked like filing cabinets
laundry hanging motionless in grey air

The tram announces itself
with metal shriek on metal
Doors open
and the queue dissolves

Bodies push inward
against bodies pushing out
No order, no queue
just pressure finding space

The tram lurches forward
paint peeling from its flanks
Someone's elbow catches my ribs
This is how movement happens here
