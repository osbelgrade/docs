I met my next-door neighbour this morning.

Another fourth-floor dweller.

I'd seen the pram
parked by his door
every day for over two weeks now—
evidence of a life
running parallel to mine.

His arms were full of laundry
when we finally spoke.

Vuk.

His name is Vuk.

I'm David, I say.

We shook hands as we entered the lift,
his laundry basket awkward between us.

That silence elevators create—
the slow mechanical descent
making every second longer,
louder.

He was going to the garage below ground.

I was going for coffee.

He smiled as the doors began to close,

and disappeared.
