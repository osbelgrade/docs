Everything grey,
rain falling in sheets—

wrapped in winter clothing for the first time,
splashed by cars carving through enormous puddles.

The housing estates drowning,
lakes where courtyards should be.

Then turning the corner onto New Pendeli—
vibrant life:

People everywhere. Shopping.
Sitting outside every shop, smoking, gesticulating.

A world I'd never seen before,
newly exciting,

waterworld—

where I bought water through a hole in the wall
as my AirPods failed.
