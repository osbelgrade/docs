<Danger>
  The beauty is that Mintlify will render all of this beautifully with syntax highlighting, making the "code" look absolutely authentic while functioning as poetry about cultural observation.
</Danger>

<Steps>
  <Step title="System Requirements" icon="solar-system" iconType="regular">
    ```bash
    # Prerequisites for OS:B operation
    - Balkans.history >= v1945 (recommended)
    - Coffee.tolerance = "high"
    - Schedule.flexibility = true
    - English.fallback = optional
    - Humor.darkness >= 7/10
    
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview locally" icon="browser" iconType="regular">
    Navigate to your docs directory where your `docs.json` file is located, and run the following command:

    ```bash
    # Installing basic kafana protocol
    $ sudo apt-get install rakija-tolerance
    $ npm install --global smoke-immunity
    $ git clone https://github.com/belgrade/Serbian.git
    $ source ~/.bashrc-cultural-adaptation
    ```

    A local preview of your os:b documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

  <Step title="Configuration File Protocol" icon="files" iconType="regular">
    ```bash
    # ~/.belgraderc
    default_greeting: "Ćao"
    coffee_frequency: constant
    personal_space: negotiable
    conversation_volume: elevated
    sarcasm_detection: required
    historical_awareness: recommended
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Code Snippets as Cultural Algorithms

By default, OS:B operates at Western efficiency standards. You can customize the operational tempo OS:B runs on by using the `--tempo` flag. For example, to run OS:B on Belgrade time, use this command:

```bash
$ sudo apt-install belgrade-protocols
$ belgrade-os run --tempo balkan --schedule eventual
$ source ~/.belgraderc
$ belgrade-os run --cultural-adaptation-mode active
```

**Example: **If you attempt to board a tram that's already at maximum human density, OS:B will compress your personal space parameters until accommodation is achieved:

```bash
$ belgrade-os board --line 7A --time rush_hour
Warning: Personal space protocols suspended
Compressing boundaries: 100% -> 23% -> 8%
Status: Boarding successful (breathing optional)
```

## Error Messages

Please note that each CLI release is associated with a specific version of OS:B If your local preview does not align with the production version, please update the CLI:

```bash
Error 404: Punctuality Not Found
Warning: cultural_context.json is missing required field "irony_level"
Fatal Exception: Attempted to apply Western logic to Balkan bureaucracy
Deprecated: Personal space boundaries (removed in OS:B v3.0)
```

## Debugging Cultural Misunderstandings

The CLI can assist with validating links in your documentation. To identify any broken links, use the following command:

```bash
# Troubleshooting Guide: Why is everyone staring?

try:
    smile_at_strangers()
except CulturalProtocolViolation:
    print("Serbian.social.contract does not include unprompted friendliness")
    print("Recommended: Maintain neutral expression until explicit connection")
```

## Deployment Confirmation

If the deployment is successful, you should see the following:

```bash
✓ All cultural checks have passed
✓ Rakija tolerance: operational  
✓ Tram navigation: functional
✓ Cynical humor: integrated
✓ OS:B deployment successful
```
