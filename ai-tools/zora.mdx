## System Overview

Zora is named after the Serbian "зора" (dawn/daybreak) and she functions as an intelligent query interface for users attempting to understand OS:B protocols documented throughout this site

<Info>
  **Note**: Zora v1.0 will be deprecated on 13.10.2025. OS:B apologises for any inconvenience. A new installation is on the OS:B roadmap.
</Info>

## Core Functionality

Zora processes natural language queries about OS:B documentation using agentic retrieval-augmented generation powered by Claude Sonnet 4. When users submit protocol clarification requests, Zora:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Searches Documentation" icon="message-quote" iconType="solid">
    Retrieves relevant observations, protocol specifications, and system documentation to provide accurate contextual responses.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Provides Source Citations" icon="message-quote" iconType="solid">
    Links directly to referenced pages within OS:B modules, enabling users to examine full documentation context.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Generates Code Examples" icon="message-quote" iconType="solid">
    Creates executable code snippets demonstrating cultural protocol implementation based on documented observations.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Identifies Documentation Gaps" icon="message-quote" iconType="solid">
    Tracks frequently asked questions that may require additional protocol documentation or clarification.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Accessing Zora

Three methods for initiating query interface:

**Keyboard Shortcut**\
`Cmd + I` (macOS) or `Ctrl + I` (Windows/Linux)

**Assistant Button**\
Located adjacent to foot of viewport

**Direct URL Parameter**\
Append `?assistant=open` to any OS:B page URL to launch Zora on page load

## Query Types Supported

Zora can assist with:

- **Protocol Clarification**: `"How does tram boarding actually work in Belgrade?"`
- **Module Navigation**: `"Show me observations about kafana culture"`
- **Technical Implementation**: `"How should I format a new observation entry?"`
- **Contextual Reference**: `"What does 'Belgrade volume' mean?"`
- **Cross-Reference**: `"Find all observations from Banjica district"`
- **System Architecture**: `"Explain the five module structure"`

## Limitations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Scope Boundaries" icon="circle-stop" iconType="solid">
    Zora operates only on documented OS:B content. Questions about protocols not yet observed or documented will receive acknowledgment of documentation gaps rather than speculation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Deflection Protocol" icon="circle-stop" iconType="solid">
    Queries outside Zora's operational parameters are redirected to [david@reticulate.blog](mailto:david@reticulate.blog) for direct consultation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="External Resources" icon="circle-stop" iconType="solid">
    Zora cannot access external Belgrade documentation or general travel resources. Responses derive exclusively from OS:B systematic observations.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Query Analytics

OS:B monitors query patterns to identify:

- `Content gaps` requiring additional protocol documentation
- `High-traffic observation` modules indicating user interest areas
- `Unsuccessful query patterns` revealing documentation clarity issues
- `Common confusion points` needing enhanced explanation

These analytics inform ongoing documentation development and module expansion.

## Optimising Zora Interactions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Effective Query Patterns" icon="clipboard-question" iconType="solid">
    - Specific protocol questions: `"What's the queue dissolution pattern for tram boarding?"`
    - Module-specific searches: `"Find User Interface observations"`
    - Technical implementation: `"Show me the Python template structure"`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Less Effective Patterns" icon="clipboard-question" iconType="solid">
    - Questions requiring lived experience: `"What should I do in Belgrade?"`
    - Speculation requests: `"Will I enjoy kafana culture?"`
    - Content not yet documented: `"How do Serbian weddings work?"`
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Technical Architecture

Zora utilises:

- **Semantic Search**: Natural language processing for intent recognition
- **Contextual Retrieval**: RAG architecture accessing full OS:B documentation corpus
- **Source Attribution**: Automatic citation linking to referenced observations
- **Code Generation**: Python snippet creation following OS:B template standards

## Privacy & Data Usage

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Query Logging" icon="shield-halved" iconType="solid">
    All queries are logged for documentation improvement analysis. No personal identification data collected beyond query content and timestamp.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Export Capability" icon="shield-halved" iconType="solid">
    Query analytics available for review in dashboard interface, exportable as CSV for analysis.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Usage Limits" icon="shield-halved" iconType="solid">
    Zora operates within platform message allowances. Excessive usage may trigger temporary rate limiting.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Integration with OS:B Methodology

Zora functions as meta-documentation layer - a system for navigating documentation about Belgrade's systems. This recursive structure mirrors the project's investigation of how we understand cultural operating systems through systematic observation.

<Info>
  Users encountering Belgrade's actual cultural software benefit from Zora's assistance navigating the documentation of that software. The assistant doesn't replace direct experience; it facilitates understanding of documented experience.
</Info>

## Status & Availability

**Current Status**: `Operational`\
**Version**: `Integrated with Claude Sonnet 4`\
**Uptime**: `Continuous during platform availability`\
**Response Time**: `Near-instantaneous for standard queries`

<Warning>
  **Note**: Zora cannot observe Belgrade for you. The assistant helps you navigate existing documentation - actual protocol discovery requires direct engagement with the city's operating system. Get out there and observe.
