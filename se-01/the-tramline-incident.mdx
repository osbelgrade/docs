The online timetables are working
for the first time since I arrived.

Getting on the tram feels more reassuring.

It wasn't long before it stops, though
the driver leaving his cabin to run to the back.

Two drunks fighting.

The other passengers hardly glance.

Firmly removed, they continue their battle
on the sidewalk
as we move off.

The public transport is free here,
welcoming all sorts, it seems

That's just one of the prices
the good people of Belgrade have to pay.

This is no refuge.
