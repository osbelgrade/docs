Week one:

Belgrade was a collection of sights.
Unconnected facts about a city
I didn't know how to read yet.

Everything foreign,
therefore fascinating.

Week two:

Patterns began to emerge.

The way light falls at rush hour.
The foot traffic that reveals desire lines
no planner ever intended.

Four languages spoken
in as many doorways.

Week four:

Something shifted.

I can't point to the exact moment—
no revelation, no dramatic change—

but the city stopped being
an object I was observing

and became a relationship
I was in.

Attention stopped being effort.
It became habit.

Every walk had been reconnaissance
without me knowing it.

Every casual observation
had been calibration.

Belgrade was patient
with my initial blindness.

Now it's generous
with its complexity.

The rose is opening—

not just the city revealing itself,

but me learning to see
what was always there.
