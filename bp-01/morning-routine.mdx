I get up every morning at 5:00.

Sitting on the balcony with that silence—
the kind that exists before the city remembers itself.

Only the birds,
their scattered commentary.

And the rattle of the ancient tram number 09
heading to Blok 45,
metal grinding against metal,
older than memory.

The brutalist tower blocks across the road are dark at first,
concrete monuments holding their breath.

Then: one light.

High up.
Eighth floor, maybe ninth.

Must have a great view from there.

All I see is a shadowy figure
moving across the window,

and the glowing tip of a cigarette—
that orange pulse in the pre-dawn grey.

I could set my clock by him.
5:03, 5:04 at the latest.

It became reassuring.
Part of the morning's architecture.

Until one day there was no light.
