The old man walked towards me along the tramlines,
big he was, properly down at heel,

pushing a green wheelie bin
on some hand-made contraption,
wheels underneath wheels.

Sticking out: a classic witch's broom.
Swinging from its handle: a litre of vodka.

He emptied the rubbish bin,
then began to sweep the platform
carefully,

stopping every few seconds
to look up.

As he approached, he smiled broadly - 

and in perfect English said,
"Must make tidy, please..."
