It's late.

I walk into the local shop to buy water.

That familiar unease—
the one that comes when shopping off the beaten track,
away from the tourist zones,
where your foreignness becomes obvious
and you wait to be treated accordingly.

Two waters.
One beer.
A packet of Lucky Strike.

440 Dinars.

I thank her in Serbian—
"Hvala"—
and offer my card.

She takes it without a word.

Tap.

Transaction complete.

No drama.
No difficulty.
Friendly.
Kind.

I'm turning to leave,
feeling quietly relieved,

when the boy behind me in line shouts:

"Manchester United!"

Grinning.

As if this explains everything.
As if football is the universal handshake
we've both been waiting for.

I laugh.

He laughs.

I walk out into the Belgrade night

feeling a little less foreign
than when I walked in.
