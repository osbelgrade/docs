Belgrade morphs as I cross the Sava—

the hills recede,
parks assemble themselves in pragmatic grids,
the river stretches wider, slackens,
the sky deepens, unsure.

Danube-side—
crows patrol concrete,
models of patience.

Chestnuts hammer the asphalt,
momentarily stirring the ice cream sellers
from their fixed gaze.

Half-hearted roasting of conkers,
river’s slap, children’s shouts,
kneaded together in Sunday’s slow light.

Here, nothing urgent is permitted.
Time floats.

Until—
glass erupts at Ušće:
a monument to immediacy,
to the suspended amnesia of shopping.

Buses line up—
their humming steady as a liturgy,
faces pointed east. Their certainty absolute.

Sajmište’s entrance,
overgrown, almost ceremonial—
waits, hesitant.
Its silence cracks as we depart.

The gates call out,
nearly an accusation,
yet the bus continues.
