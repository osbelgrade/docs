There's a café I pass most days.

The owner has made a garden
in the space between the building and the street—

narrow strip of earth
where nothing should grow.

Concrete surrounds it.
Traffic fumes past.
Exhaust hangs in the air.

But somehow:

roses.

Actual roses.

Pink against grey walls,
blooming with such deliberate beauty
it almost feels like defiance.

And he tends them too

I've watched him—
early evenings,
watering can in hand,
checking leaves,
deadheading spent flowers with careful fingers.

This shouldn't work.

The conditions don't support it.
The logic doesn't add up.

But here they are anyway,

insisting on themselves,

tended with obvious love.

The roses of Belgrade
blooming between the cracks.
