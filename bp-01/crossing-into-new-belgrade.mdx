Belgrade changes as I cross the Sava -

the hills collapse behind me,
orderly parks fill my eyes,
the river is wider here,
the sky opening.

Walking along the Danube,
crows maintain their watch from the concrete embankment.

The conkers fall,
momentarily distracting the ice cream sellers
who barely look up.

Chestnuts roast half-heartedly
to the lapping sounds of the river
and cries from playing children,

lost in time,
or so it feels - 

that particular Friday afternoon peace
where nothing urgent exists.

Then: shattered.

The Ušće shopping centre
rising like a glass monument to now,
to buying things,
to forgetting.

The relentless queue of buses
joining traffic heading east,
their diesel rhythm,
their destination certainty.

And there, quietly observing it all:
the gates of Sajmište,
overgrown with weeds,
patient,
waiting.

They cry out to me
as we pull away,

but the bus doesn't stop for them.
