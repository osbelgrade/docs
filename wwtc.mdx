## Warsaw Winter Theatre Company: Season 2

OS:B is the Belgrade chapter of the **Warsaw Winter Theatre Company's** traveling investigation methodology. It's Residence 2, if you like - a continuation of the same core project, but requiring completely different conceptual tools.

## Different City, Different Framework

Warsaw demanded its own analytical framework: theatre company, performance, cultural simulation and so on. The city became a stage, interactions became performances, understanding became a kind of theatrical rehearsal.

Belgrade demands different tools: software, operating systems, technical protocols. Here, the city is a system to debug. Cultural experience becomes code to document. Understanding becomes installation and integration.

This isn't arbitrary. Each city reveals what it needs to be understood. Warsaw's theatrical nature called for performance theory. Belgrade's layered complexity, its resistance to easy categorisation, its systematic chaos - this calls for technical frameworks.

## Why Keep Moving?

This mobility is essential. It prevents any single framework from becoming too settled, too comfortable, too much like I actually know what I'm doing.

Just as I begin understanding how cultural performance works in one context, I shift to another requiring completely different analysis. Each city reveals the limitations of previous approaches while suggesting new ones. Warsaw showed me what theatre theory could do. Belgrade is showing me what it can't.

The method is the migration. The insight comes from watching frameworks strain and adapt.

## Building In Public

OS:B launches at [**osbelgrade.mintlify.app**](http://osbelgrade.mintlify.app) - still being built, still learning the system, still documenting the cultural software as I discover it. In the tech community they call it "Build In Public."

I'm doing that literally: writing the code, formatting the observations, publishing the documentation as I figure out how this city works.

The incompleteness is the point.

You're watching the installation process in real-time.

## What This Actually Is

This is what happens when you bring postmodern theory, poetry practice, and developer tools to a city that refuses to be easily categorized.

This is intellectual disruption disguised as technical documentation.

This is cultural analysis that insists on being created rather than passively consumed.
