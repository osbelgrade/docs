## Deployment

This guide walks through the installation process, configuration options, and common troubleshooting scenarios you'll encounter when adapting to Belgrade's operating protocols.

<Danger>
  **Critical: Proper Cultural Protocol Installation required**

  Incorrect implementation of COS:B integration procedures may result in social incompatibility, extended adaptation periods, or permanent designation as "obvious tourist." Follow all installation steps carefully. Attempting to run Western efficiency protocols on Belgrade infrastructure will cause system conflicts. Do not skip the observation phase.
</Danger>

<Steps>
  <Step title="System Requirements" icon="solar-system" iconType="regular">
    Before attempting to run COS:B protocols, ensure your system meets the minimum requirements:

    ```bash
    Balkans.history >= v1945 (recommended for context)
    Coffee.tolerance = "high" (minimum 3 cups daily)
    Schedule.flexibility = true (required)
    Personal_space.boundaries = "negotiable"
    Cynicism.threshold >= 7/10
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the Belgrade Protocol Suite" icon="browser" iconType="regular">
    Navigate to your docs directory where your `docs.json` file is located, and run the following command:

    ```bash
    $ sudo apt-install belgrade-protocols
    $ belgrade-os run --tempo balkan --schedule eventual
    $ source ~/.belgraderc
    $ belgrade-os run --cultural-adaptation-mode active
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initialise Local Integration" icon="files" iconType="regular">
    Navigate to the neighbourhood where you'll be operating and run the following command:

    ```bash
    belgrade-os init --location zemun
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Custom Operating Modes" icon="location-crosshairs" iconType="regular">
    By default, COS:B operates at Western efficiency standards. You can customize the operational tempo COS:B runs on by using the `--tempo` flag. For example, to run COS:B on Belgrade time, use this command:

    ```bash
    belgrade-os run --tempo balkan --schedule eventual
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Protocol Versions" icon="hands" iconType="regular">
    Please note that each neighbourhood is associated with a specific version of Belgrade protocols. If your local behavior does not align with the cultural expectations, please update your integration:

    ```bash
    npm update belgrade-os
    belgrade-os adapt --force
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validating Cultural Competence" icon="not-equal" iconType="regular">
    The system can assist with validating your cultural integration. To identify any protocol violations, use the following command:

    ```bash
    belgrade-os validate --interactions recent --feedback brutal
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Successful Deployment

If cultural integration is successful, you should see the following indicators:

```bash
$ belgrade-os deploy --mode full-integration

Running cultural compatibility checks...

✓ All authenticity checks have passed
✓ Rakija tolerance: operational
✓ Tram navigation: functional
✓ Cynical humor: integrated
✓ Personal space: appropriately compressed
✓ Schedule expectations: appropriately lowered

Deployment successful. Welcome to COS:B.
```

## Recommended Extensions

We suggest developing the following capabilities to enhance your COS:B experience:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Historical Context Mode" icon="rectangle-history" iconType="regular">
    Decodes references to Yugoslav-era systems, 1990s conflicts, and nostalgia-based commentary that frequently appear in local communication. Essential for understanding architectural decisions, casual historical references, and culturally-loaded conversations. Prevents misinterpretation of context-dependent social interactions and enables participation in heritage-based discussions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Volume Calibration" icon="volume" iconType="regular">
    Recalibrates audio processing thresholds to accommodate Belgrade's elevated baseline conversation volume without triggering conflict detection protocols. Differentiates between passionate discussion and actual confrontation. Eliminates false-positive aggression signals in kafanas and public spaces. Adjustment period typically requires 7-14 days of exposure.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Smoking Immunity" icon="smoking" iconType="regular">
    Manages adaptation to indoor smoking environments prevalent in kafanas and social venues. Provides expectation management protocols and seating optimisation strategies. Critical for full participation in essential cultural spaces. Does not modify health impacts - users with respiratory conditions should evaluate venue participation independently.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Serbian Language Pack" icon="flag" iconType="regular">
    Provides essential vocabulary for daily operations including in-person ordering, tram navigation, and basic apologies. Reduces dependency on English-only protocols and enables transaction completion without gesture-based workarounds. Significantly improves local perception metrics and reduces communication-based protocol violations during initial integration period.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

COS:B integration failures follow predictable patterns. Most errors occur when Western cultural protocols conflict with Belgrade's operating system. This section documents common error states, their diagnostic signatures, and resolution procedures. Execute diagnostic commands when experiencing unexpected social responses or persistent integration difficulties.

```bash
$ belgrade-os diagnose --error social_hierarchy

Error: Could not parse local social hierarchy
Status: Common initialisation error

Recommended resolution steps:

1. Enter observation mode:
   $ belgrade-os observe --duration 12weeks --mode passive

2. Establish pattern recognition:
   $ belgrade-os frequent --location same_kafana --frequency daily

3. Disable optimisation protocols:
   $ belgrade-os config --efficiency false --patience true

4. Reinstall humility protocols:
   $ sudo apt-get install humility-core
   $ belgrade-os reset --assumptions western --ego false
```

## Code Snippets as Cultural Algorithms

COS:B documents cultural protocols through executable code that functions as both valid programming logic and poetic observation. Each snippet captures behavioral patterns in algorithmic form.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Cultural Algorithm: Kafana Time Perception
"""

def calculate_duration(clock_time, social_context):
    """
    Converts Western time measurements to Belgrade kafana time.
    Note: clock_time parameter is decorative only.
    """
    
    if social_context == "good_conversation":
        perceived_time = clock_time * 0.3
        urgency_level = 0
        
    elif social_context == "waiting_for_bill":
        perceived_time = clock_time * 2.5
        urgency_level = "irrelevant"
        
    else:
        perceived_time = "eventually"
    
    return {
        "actual_duration": clock_time,
        "experienced_duration": perceived_time,
        "concern_level": None,
        "status": "This is how time works here"
    }

# Example execution
>>> calculate_duration(180, "good_conversation")
{
    "actual_duration": 180,
    "experienced_duration": 54,
    "concern_level": None, 
    "status": "This is how time works here"
}
```

For example, if you attempt to board a tram that's already at maximum human density, COS:B will compress your personal space parameters until accommodation is achieved:

```bash
$ belgrade-os board --line 7A --time rush_hour
Warning: Personal space protocols suspended
Compressing boundaries: 100% -> 23% -> 8%
Status: Boarding successful (breathing optional)
```

## Error Messages

Protocol version conflicts occur when local behavioral patterns do not match neighborhood-specific implementations. Each district operates distinct social software variants. Update integration parameters when encountering compatibility errors.

```bash
Error 404: Punctuality Not Found
Warning: cultural_context.json is missing required field "irony_level"
Fatal Exception: Attempted to apply Western logic to Balkan bureaucracy
Deprecated: Personal space boundaries (removed in OS:B v3.0)
```

## Debugging Cultural Misunderstandings

Diagnostic commands identify protocol violations causing integration failures. Execute validation sequences when observing unexpected social responses or error states in local interactions.

```bash
$ belgrade-os validate --interactions recent

Recommended action:
  $ belgrade-os reset --assumptions false
  $ belgrade-os observe --mode passive --duration extended
  $ belgrade-os adapt --based-on local_behavior

```

## Deployment Confirmation

Successful cultural integration produces specific observable indicators. Execute status checks to verify COS:B protocols are functioning correctly. System will output confirmation messages when behavioral adaptation reaches operational thresholds.

```bash
$ belgrade-os deploy --mode full-integration

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Error - Western Efficiency Protocols Still Active" icon="bomb" iconType="regular">
    Cultural integration failing due to persistent optimisation attempts. Belgrade systems reject efficiency-focused behavioral patterns.

    **Resolution steps:**

    1. Disable urgency modules: `belgrade-os config --urgency false --patience infinite`
    2. Remove schedule dependency: `belgrade-os uninstall western-time-expectations`
    3. Accept that "10 minutes" means "eventually": `belgrade-os learn --temporal-flexibility true`
    4. Reinstall with Balkan tempo: `belgrade-os reset --expectations realistic --timeline flexible`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Issue - Tram Schedule Interpretation Error" icon="circle-exclamation" iconType="regular">
    System attempting to parse tram arrival times as literal data. Belgrade tram schedules function as theoretical documentation only.

    **Resolution steps:**

    1. Stop checking posted schedules: `belgrade-os ignore --source digital_displays`
    2. Switch to experiential learning: `belgrade-os observe --pattern actual_arrivals --duration 2weeks`
    3. Accept probabilistic arrival model: `belgrade-os config --tram-expectation eventual`
    4. Learn from locals: `belgrade-os watch --target old_woman_at_stop --trust her_laugh`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Warning - Personal Space Calculations Incompatible" icon="bug" iconType="regular">
    Default Western personal space parameters cause navigation failures in crowded environments (trams, markets, kafanas).

    **Resolution steps:**

    1. Reduce boundary radius: `belgrade-os set --personal-space 0.3m`
    2. Enable compression protocols: `belgrade-os allow --body-contact occasional`
    3. Accept tram density: `belgrade-os board --full-tram true --breathing optional`
    4. Recalibrate comfort thresholds: `belgrade-os adapt --proximity-tolerance high`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Critical - Kafana Protocol Mismatch" icon="square-exclamation" iconType="regular">
    Attempting to apply café/restaurant logic to kafana environments. These are distinct social systems requiring different behavioral protocols.

    **Resolution steps:**

    1. Disable turnover optimization: `belgrade-os config --time-limit null`
    2. Understand primary function is conversation: `belgrade-os learn --purpose social_not_transactional`
    3. Accept slow service as feature: `belgrade-os reframe --waiting-time relationship_building`
    4. Order appropriately: `belgrade-os study --drinks coffee_rakija --food_optional true`
