## Notes on Version History

Each version implements fundamental protocol modifications that persist in current operations. Understanding version history is essential for interpreting why certain cultural behaviours, infrastructure decisions, and social patterns continue despite appearing obsolete or contradictory.

Legacy code from previous versions remains active in current implementation. OS:B does not deprecate historical protocols - it layers new systems over existing ones, creating complex backward compatibility requirements. Current Belgrade behaviour cannot be understood without reference to these accumulated system modifications.

<Info>
  This changelog documents significant version releases from 1945 to present, focusing on updates that permanently altered cultural operating parameters.
