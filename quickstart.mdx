title: "Quickstart"
description: "OS:B requires systematic initialisation before active deployment. This guide provides essential configuration steps for baseline cultural integration. Complete all three steps sequentially to establish minimal operational parameters."

## Get started in three steps

Initial Belgrade protocol installation follows a three-phase process: expectation recalibration, cognitive framework adjustment, and full system deployment. Each phase builds on the previous, establishing prerequisite conditions for successful cultural integration.

<Tip>
  Complete all three phases in order. Phase dependencies prevent parallel installation. Skipping steps will cause system conflicts and extend adaptation timeline.
</Tip>

### Step 1: Manage Expectation Levels

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Disable Western Efficiency Protocols" icon="align-slash" iconType="regular">
    Western temporal assumptions conflict with Belgrade operating parameters. Navigate to system configuration and set punctuality expectations to null, schedule adherence to false, and efficiency optimization to disabled. These legacy protocols will cause repeated integration failures if left active during Belgrade deployment.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Recalibrate Temporal Parameters" icon="rectangle-terminal">
    Adjust internal clock to accommodate flexible time interpretation. Published schedules function as approximate suggestions rather than binding commitments. Set arrival time buffers to +/- 30 minutes minimum. Accept that "soon" and "eventually" are functionally equivalent terms in local implementation.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Deploy Enhanced Thought Mode

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Activate Observation Protocols" icon="chart-network" iconType="regular">
    Initialize passive observation mode before attempting active social participation. Set data collection to continuous, pattern recognition to sensitive, and assumption generation to suspended. Minimum observation period: 14 days. Premature interaction attempts will trigger protocol violations and extend overall adaptation timeline.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Configure Cultural Sensitivity Settings" icon="glass" iconType="regular">
    Increase processing capacity for non-verbal communication, contextual interpretation, and ambiguous social signals. Disable binary logic for interpersonal assessment. Enable gradual learning algorithms that prioritize local behavioral patterns over imported cultural frameworks. Update frequency: daily based on observed interactions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Experience OS:B

<Accordion title="Initiate First Contact Protocols" icon="rocket">
  Begin controlled deployment of learned protocols in low-stakes environments. Start with transactional interactions: kafana orders, tram navigation, market purchases. Monitor local responses for error signals. Adjust behavioral parameters based on feedback. Early failures are expected and provide essential diagnostic data.
</Accordion>
