<Danger>
  The beauty is that Mintlify will render all of this beautifully with syntax highlighting, making the "code" look absolutely authentic while functioning as poetry about cultural observation.
</Danger>

<Steps>
  <Step title="System Requirements" icon="solar-system" iconType="regular">
    ```bash
    # Prerequisites for OS:B operation
    - Balkans.history >= v1945 (recommended)
    - Coffee.tolerance = "high"
    - Schedule.flexibility = true
    - English.fallback = optional
    - Humor.darkness >= 7/10
    
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview locally" icon="browser" iconType="regular">
    Navigate to your docs directory where your `docs.json` file is located, and run the following command:

    ```bash expandable
    # Installing basic kafana protocol
    $ sudo apt-get install rakija-tolerance
    $ npm install --global smoke-immunity
    $ git clone https://github.com/belgrade/Serbian.git
    $ source ~/.bashrc-cultural-adaptation
    ```

    A local preview of your os:b documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configuration File Protocol" icon="files" iconType="regular">
    ```bash
    # ~/.belgraderc
    default_greeting: "Ćao"
    coffee_frequency: constant
    personal_space: negotiable
    conversation_volume: elevated
    sarcasm_detection: required
    historical_awareness: recommended
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Code Snippets as Cultural Algorithms

By default, OS:B uses port 3000. You can customise the port OS:B runs on by using the `--port` flag. For example, to run OS:B on port 3333, use this command:

```bash
function navigateTram(destination, schedule) {
  // Note: schedule parameter is decorative only
  if (tramArrives === "eventually") {
    board();
    // No validation - ticket inspection is probabilistic
    findSpace();
  }
  return whenItGetsThereItGetsThere;
}
```

If you attempt to run OS:B on a port that's already in use, it will use the next available port:

```bash
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

## Error Messages

Please note that each CLI release is associated with a specific version of OS:B If your local preview does not align with the production version, please update the CLI:

```bash
Error 404: Punctuality Not Found
Warning: cultural_context.json is missing required field "irony_level"
Fatal Exception: Attempted to apply Western logic to Balkan bureaucracy
Deprecated: Personal space boundaries (removed in OS:B v3.0)
```

## Debugging Cultural Misunderstandings

The CLI can assist with validating links in your documentation. To identify any broken links, use the following command:

```bash
# Troubleshooting Guide: Why is everyone staring?

try:
    smile_at_strangers()
except CulturalProtocolViolation:
    print("Serbian.social.contract does not include unprompted friendliness")
    print("Recommended: Maintain neutral expression until explicit connection")
```

## Deployment Confirmation

If the deployment is successful, you should see the following:

```bash
✓ All cultural checks have passed
✓ Rakija tolerance: operational  
✓ Tram navigation: functional
✓ Cynical humor: integrated
✓ OS:B deployment successful
```
