A walk across the suburban hills to the camp.

The church a brutalist statement in concrete
as water dripped
from rusted pipes.

The lady reading her book
on the edge of the mass grave
as clouds raced overhead.

Flowers dropping to the sound of the workmen—
working?
On a Sunday?

No gravity as prescribed here
and no sense of foreboding
Or at least the sense that I am used to.

The happy dog followed me.
