## System Overview

Zora is named after the Serbian "зора" (dawn/daybreak) and she functions as an intelligent query interface for users attempting to understand OS:B protocols documented throughout this site

## Core Functionality

Zora processes natural language queries about OS:B documentation using agentic retrieval-augmented generation powered by Claude Sonnet 4. When users submit protocol clarification requests, Zora:

**Searches Documentation**\
Retrieves relevant observations, protocol specifications, and system documentation to provide accurate contextual responses.

**Provides Source Citations**\
Links directly to referenced pages within OS:B modules, enabling users to examine full documentation context.

**Generates Code Examples**\
Creates executable code snippets demonstrating cultural protocol implementation based on documented observations.

**Identifies Documentation Gaps**\
Tracks frequently asked questions that may require additional protocol documentation or clarification.

## Accessing Zora

Three methods for initiating query interface:

**Keyboard Shortcut**\
`Cmd + I` (macOS) or `Ctrl + I` (Windows/Linux)

**Assistant Button**\
Located adjacent to search functionality in site navigation

**Direct URL Parameter**\
Append `?assistant=open` to any OS:B page URL to launch Zora on page load

## Query Types Supported

Zora can assist with:

- **Protocol Clarification**: "How does tram boarding actually work in Belgrade?"
- **Module Navigation**: "Show me observations about kafana culture"
- **Technical Implementation**: "How should I format a new observation entry?"
- **Contextual Reference**: "What does 'Belgrade volume' mean?"
- **Cross-Reference**: "Find all observations from Banjica district"
- **System Architecture**: "Explain the five module structure"

## Limitations

**Scope Boundaries**\
Zora operates only on documented OS:B content. Questions about protocols not yet observed or documented will receive acknowledgment of documentation gaps rather than speculation.

**Deflection Protocol**\
Queries outside Zora's operational parameters are redirected to [david@reticulate.blog](mailto:david@reticulate.blog) for direct consultation.

**External Resources**\
Zora cannot access external Belgrade documentation or general travel resources. Responses derive exclusively from OS:B systematic observations.

## Query Analytics

OS:B monitors query patterns to identify:

- Content gaps requiring additional protocol documentation
- High-traffic observation modules indicating user interest areas
- Unsuccessful query patterns revealing documentation clarity issues
- Common confusion points needing enhanced explanation

These analytics inform ongoing documentation development and module expansion.

## Optimizing Zora Interactions

**Effective Query Patterns:**

- Specific protocol questions: "What's the queue dissolution pattern for tram boarding?"
- Module-specific searches: "Find User Interface observations"
- Technical implementation: "Show me the Python template structure"

**Less Effective Patterns:**

- Questions requiring lived experience: "What should I do in Belgrade?"
- Speculation requests: "Will I enjoy kafana culture?"
- Content not yet documented: "How do Serbian weddings work?"

Zora assists with navigating existing documentation, not creating new observations. Documentation expands organically through systematic field observation.

## Technical Architecture

Zora utilizes:

- **Semantic Search**: Natural language processing for intent recognition
- **Contextual Retrieval**: RAG architecture accessing full OS:B documentation corpus
- **Source Attribution**: Automatic citation linking to referenced observations
- **Code Generation**: Python snippet creation following OS:B template standards

## Privacy & Data Usage

**Query Logging**\
All queries are logged for documentation improvement analysis. No personal identification data collected beyond query content and timestamp.

**Export Capability**\
Query analytics available for review in dashboard interface, exportable as CSV for analysis.

**Usage Limits**\
Zora operates within platform message allowances. Excessive usage may trigger temporary rate limiting.

## Integration with OS:B Methodology

Zora functions as meta-documentation layer - a system for navigating documentation about Belgrade's systems. This recursive structure mirrors the project's investigation of how we understand cultural operating systems through systematic observation.

Users encountering Belgrade's actual cultural software benefit from Zora's assistance navigating the documentation of that software. The assistant doesn't replace direct experience; it facilitates understanding of documented experience.

## Status & Availability

**Current Status**: Operational\
**Version**: Integrated with Claude Sonnet 4\
**Uptime**: Continuous during platform availability\
**Response Time**: Near-instantaneous for standard queries

**Note**: Zora cannot observe Belgrade for you. The assistant helps you navigate existing documentation - actual protocol discovery requires direct engagement with the city's operating system. Get out there and observe.
