## Creativity Through Assembly

I don't believe in waiting for the perfect tool or the complete skill set before making something. I believe in using whatever works to get the idea out of your head and into the world.

This project exists because I combined tools I already knew with tools I'm learning, frameworks I understand with frameworks I'm figuring out, established platforms with experimental approaches. Poetry written in code editors. Cultural theory formatted as technical documentation. Observations logged like bug reports.

The creative process isn't about mastering one tool perfectly - it's about knowing enough tools to solve the specific problem in front of you right now. Can't write traditional poetry? Format it as Python. Don't know how to structure observations? Borrow from software documentation. Need a publishing platform? Find one that handles technical formatting.

Each tool does one thing well. Together, they enable something that wouldn't exist otherwise.

Here's what I used to build OS:B:
