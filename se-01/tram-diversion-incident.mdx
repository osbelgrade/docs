The driver's voice crackles through the tram—
Serbian, urgent, incomprehensible.

Around me, a bustle.
People gathering bags,
moving toward the doors.

I stay seated.

Whatever he said doesn't apply to me.
I know where I'm going.

The tram empties by half.

We pull away.

Victory.

Two minutes later: stopped again.

The driver emerges from his cabin
carrying a long metal hook—
industrial, purposeful—

jumps down to the tracks,
jams the hook into the rails,
yanks something free with a metallic scrape,

climbs back in shouting.

The few remaining passengers stand,
file past me without eye contact,
step down to the platform.

I watch them go.

Then follow.

Like a lemming.

The platform is battered, nameless.
Concrete cracking under weeds.
No signage I can read.

I'm the only one standing here now.

Phone out:
completely wrong direction.
Kilometres from where I need to be.

Right.

Time to replan.

Ten minutes.
Two blue buses.
Finally: arrival.

Here's to Belgrade public transport—

and the mysteries it keeps.
